# Scrapers
This is where I keep all the scraper scripts that I cobble together.

So far, we've got: 
* [Setlist.fm scraper](https://github.com/ryanleewatts/scrapers/blob/master/SetlistScript.py) - For grabbing setlist information for bands and music acts.
* [CAA scraper](https://github.com/ryanleewatts/scrapers/blob/master/CAA%20Data.ipynb) - UK Flight punctuality data from Civil Aviation Authority
